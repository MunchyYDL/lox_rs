# Crafting Interpreters

https://craftinginterpreters.com/

This awesome resource works through the implementation of an interpreter for the Lox programming language, but does so in Java, which is not my language of choice.

So this is an attempt to convert it to Rust while following along with the book.

> Disclaimer! 
I'm new to the concept of interpreters and programming language design, while also not an experienced Rust user. I won't take responsibility for any harm caused by reading this source! :)

I will try to keep the source close to the original design at first, while keeping the chapter numbers in my commit messages, to be easily cross-referenced by anyone interested.

I might change some things after the fact, to be more Rusty ðŸ¦€, but I will try to keep that in separate commits after the first straight conversion from Java is done.

Keep your fingers crossed, and that might actually be something I remember to do! :)
